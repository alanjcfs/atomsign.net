# Starting with Nuxt.js

I first got introduced to Nuxt.js by Brian Stanley while working at FII, now called UpTogether. At first, I didn't
understand how it was supposed to work, but the elegance of being able to create a page by just adding a new markdown
page cannot be overstated.

It was a bit challenging figuring out what needed to be installed, because I wanted several things built in, typography,
Tailwind CSS, and I wanted to still be able to write Vue code.

You'll need to run

```bash
npx nuxi init -t content <app> # Gets you started with a content app
yarn add @nuxt/ui # gets you started with basic tailwind css. This will erase all styling, which you can restore with
yarn add -D @tailwindcss/typography # sets you up with basic styling
```

You should have `pages/[...slug].vue` created with the following content:

```html
<template>
  <article>
    <ContentDoc />
  </article>
</template>

```

In `nuxt.config.ts`:

```javascript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  devtools: { enabled: true },
  modules: ["@nuxt/ui", "@nuxt/content", "@nuxtjs/tailwindcss"],
  content: {},
  css: ["~/assets/css/tailwind.css"], # optional, if you don't plan to stick with tailwind css default
})
```

In `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    `content/**/*.md`,
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  ],
}
```
